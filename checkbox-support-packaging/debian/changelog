checkbox-support (0.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Sylvain Pineau ]
  * New upstream release

  [ Zygmunt Krynicki ]
  * Use armoured gpg keys to avoid having to keep binary files in Debian
    packaging. Also, replace that with my key since I made the 0.2 release
    upstream. 
  * Patch away checkbox_support.vendor.mock. Also add a copyright entry for
    that module. Both changes are similar to what we do in python3-plainbox.
