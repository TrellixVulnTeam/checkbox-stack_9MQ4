unit: test plan
_description:
    This test plan is intended to be used for retesting of network devices
    only.  It does not provide any testing of other hardware and should only be
    run at the direction of the Cert Team when re-testing of network devices is
    requried.  This test plan disabled the speed check and is intended for use
    when network devices do not accurately report supported speeds.
