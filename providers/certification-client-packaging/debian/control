Description: Client Certification provider for Plainbox
 This package provides a test set of test plans that are used by Canonical
 for the testing and certification of "client" devices. Client devices include
 laptops, desktops and all-in-one machines.
 .
 The actual tests (also known as plainbox jobs) are sourced from checkbox and
 plainbox resource providers. This package only contains the test plans
 themselves.

 file to the Canonical Certification Website. It is useful for sending test
 results that were collected in an off-line environment.

Package: plainbox-glmark2-es2-meta
Architecture: any
Depends: glmark2-es2 [arm64 armhf], ${misc:Depends}
Description: Meta-package to selectively install glmark2-es2
 The objective of this metapackage is not introducing architecture specificity
 in plainbox-provider-certification-client. This metapackage will cause
 installation of glmark2-es2 on arm architectures, while just being a dummy
 package on others. Arch-independent packages can depend on this one to (maybe)
 install glmark2-es2.
