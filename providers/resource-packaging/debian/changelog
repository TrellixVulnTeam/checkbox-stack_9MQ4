  * New upstream release. List of bugfixes:
    https://launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-resource/14.04/0.3
  * debian/watch: look for new releases on launchpad
  * debian/control: make plainbox-provider-resource-generic arch=any as it
    builds C source for one provider-specific executable now, also depend on
    autotools, intltool and two netlink libraries
  * debian/rules: stop using pybuild and use manage.py
    {i18n,build,install,validate} instead. The build rule also regenerates.
    autotools scripts that are present in the tarball.
  * debian/control: drop X-Python3-Version 
  * debian/patches: drop (no longer needed)
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: Use armoured gpg keys to avoid having to
    keep binary files in Debian packaging. Also, replace that with my key
    since I made the 0.3 release upstream.
  * debian/source/include-binaries: no longer needed 
  * Stop being a python3 module, move to from DPMT to PAPT
